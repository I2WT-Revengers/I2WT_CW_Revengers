            <h2>1. Register a domain</h2>
            <p>
                Domain is the name of your site. It should be unique and convey the brand of your business. The easiest way to find and register a domain is to go to a domain registrar. A domain registrar will allow you to register your domain name under either annual contracts or long term contracts.

            <h2>2. Buy web hosting</h2>
            <p>
                A web host is a large computer (aka a server) that hosts your websites. Some giant companies like Amazon, IBM and FB own and operate their own web servers; other companies simply rent their servers from a hosting provider (which is much cheaper and easier).
            </p>
            <span>Today, web hosting comes in a variety of packages.</span>
            <p>
                Traditionally, a web hosting provider is only concerned with renting out servers with basic software and technical support. Hosting your website with a traditional hosting provider is usually cheaper and more flexible; but you need a little extra work to set up the website.
            </p>
            <p>
                Companies are now bundling various services together and allowing users to create, host and manage websites from a single service provider. These companies are commonly referred to as website builders or online store builders. Hosting a website on these "complex" platforms is usually expensive and less flexible; but you can easily create a website or online store.

            <p>
                Once you've got your domain name and web hosting, it's time to roll up your sleeves and get creative! To design and build web pages, you can hire a web developer or do it yourself.

                        HTML (from English HyperText Markup Language) is a hypertext markup language for a page. It is used to tell the browser how to display the loaded site.
                        The language consists of tags - these are a kind of commands that are converted into visual objects in the user's browser. For example, the img tag is used to position images on a page. It has the required src attribute, which specifies a link to the file.

                        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
                        CSS is a style that is used to style HTML markup on a web page. Without CSS, the web page will look like nothing more than a large white page with some unordered text and an image on it. CSS is what makes the page as perfect as we want it to be.

                        It is a programming language that runs in the browser of a web page visitor. This is not Java, as beginners sometimes abbreviate JavaScript. Java is completely different and has nothing to do with JavaScript. The latter was conceived and created in order to add some interactivity and bring websites to life.

                        In website development, JS comes along with HTML and CSS. HTML defines the layout of the page, CSS defines the look and feel, and JavaScript brings interactivity. That is, with its help we can describe how the markup and styles will react to certain user actions.

            <h2>IDE</h2>
            <p>
                A good local working environment is essential for creating and organizing website source files. You can create a web development environment on your computer device by installing an IDE (Integrated Development Environment). The IDE mainly consists of a text editor, build automation, and a debugger.
                <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com">Sublime Text</a> and <a href="http://brackets.io">Brackets</a> are some of the main IDEs for web development, supporting HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, Python and similar web languages.
                On the other hand, there are advanced IDEs such as Adobe Dreamweaver that offer several other features (eg server connection, FTP).
