            <h2>The late 80s</h2>  <h2 class="names">The Dark Age of Web Design</h2>
            <p id="80s">
                The very beginning of web design can be called the dark times, because the screens were literally black, containing only a small number of monochrome pixels. Design was done with symbols and tabs back then, so we'll move forward at a time when graphical user interfaces were the main tool for surfing the web. Those days of table layout can be called the Wild West of the web.
            </p>
            <h2>1995</h2>  <h2 class="names">Tables - Beginning</h2>
            <p id="1995">
                The advent of browsers capable of displaying images was the first step in web design as we know it today. The most accessible way to structure information was the concept of using tables, which at that time became available in HTML. Therefore, putting tables inside other tables and mixing static cells with cells of relative sizes began with the book "Creating Killer Sites" by David Siegel. The use of tables for such purposes did not seem entirely correct, since their main purpose is to structure information. And yet, this method of web design has been the most prevalent for a long time. Then there was another problem - the preservation of the operability of these fragile structures. At the same time, “cutting layouts” into separate elements has gained popularity. The designers drew beautiful layouts, and the developers were engaged in dividing them into smaller parts and gluing them so that the design works as it should. On the other hand, tables had such gorgeous features as the ability to vertically align content, determine its size in pixels and in percentages. The main advantage of tables was that they allowed you to recreate the grid structure as closely as possible. At the same time, the developers realized that they had ceased to love external interfaces and their development.

            <h2>1995</h2> <h2 class="names">Javascript Comes to the Rescue</h2>
            <p id="1995.1">
                Javascript was the answer to the limitations of HTML. Want to display a pop-up window? Or do you need to set up dynamic re-positioning of elements? There is only one answer - Javascript. However, the main problem was that Javascript lay on top of the material that makes up the web and, accordingly, had to be loaded separately. It is often used by lazy developers to create a quick patch for their code, but in the right hands it can turn into a very powerful tool. These days, we prefer to avoid using Javascript if the same element can be implemented using CCS, but even so, JavaScript is still relevant today in both front-end (jQuery) and server-side programming (Node. js).
            </p>
            <h2>1996</h2> <h2 class="names">Golden Age of Freedom - Flash</h2>
            <p  id="1996">
                Introduced in 1996, the technology promised unprecedented freedom and aimed to break down the barriers that held back the development of web design at the time. The designer could work with any shape, size of layouts, animations, interactions and use any font, all with the help of one tool - Flash technology. The final result of the work was packed into one file, and then sent to the browser for display. All this worked provided that the user had the latest version of the flash plugin and had some free time to wait for the content to load. It looked magical. That time was the golden age of bright welcome pages, introductory animations and all kinds of interactive effects. Unfortunately, the technology clearly lacked openness, search-friendliness, and the consumption of Flash resources was really high. When Apple decided to get rid of it in its first iPhone (2007), the technology began to fade, at least from a web design perspective.
            </p>
            <h2>1998</h2>  <h2 class="names">CSS</h2>
            <p id="1998">
                Around the same time as Flash, another, better from a technical point of view, way of structuring design emerged - Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). Its basic concept was to separate the functions of the content container from the functions of its presentation, such that the content itself was placed in HTML, and its visual formatting was done using CSS. The early versions of the technology were far from flexible, but the biggest problem was the slow speed of adaptation of browsers to it. It took several years to introduce full browser support for CSS, and it was often bugged with its use. At the same time, it often happened that the newest CSS properties were supported in only one browser, while others did not. For developers, this has become a real nightmare. It is also important to clarify here that CSS is not a coding language, but rather a language for declaring properties of objects, and if the question of whether designers need to learn how to write code remains open, then the answer to the question "Should they understand how CSS works?" will definitely be positive.

            <h2>2007</h2>  <h2 class="names">The Rise of Mobile Content - Grids and Frameworks</h2>
            <p id="2007">
                Browsing the web on mobile phones is on its own was a test.And besides the difference in the sizes of layouts for different devices, the problem of design correspondence also appeared: is it worth displaying the same version of the site on the small screen as on the large one, or should some of its parts be abandoned? And where to insert all this flickering ads on such a tiny screen? Speed ​​was also an issue, as downloading a lot of content burns your entire mobile balance pretty quickly. The first step to improve the situation was the idea of ​​using column grids.

                After several iterations, the 960 px grid won, and the 12-column division began to be used predominantly by designers. The next step was to standardize common elements such as forms, navigation menus, buttons, and create the ability to use them quickly and easily, or, simply put, creating a library of visual elements that contains all the necessary code. The winners here are Bootstrap and Foundation, which also speaks to the fact that the line between website and application is blurring. The downside to this approach was that new designs began to look the same more often. At the same time, the designers themselves still could not access their changes without understanding how the code works.
            </p>
            <h2>2010</h2>  <h2 class="names">Responsive Web Design</h2>
            <p id="2010">
                A smart guy named Ethan Marcot decided to challenge the existing approach by proposing to display the same content, using different layout forms to present it, calling it "Responsive web design" (responsive web design). Technically, we are still using HTML and CSS, so this is more about conceptual improvement.

                There are many misconceptions about this approach. For a designer, “responsiveness” means creating many sketches of different layouts, and for a client it means that everything will work on the phone. At the same time, the developer thinks about the page load speed, how to present images to the user, the semantic load of the elements, the priority of the mobile or desktop version, and so on ... The main advantage of this approach is to save the same content on different layouts. In practice, this means that the same website works everywhere. I hope that everyone agrees with at least this definition.
            </p>
            <h2>2010</h2>  <h2 class="names">Simplification</h2>
            <p id="2010.1">
                More layouts take more time to render. With this in mind, to our mutual happiness, the designers decided to streamline the process by getting rid of the intricate shadow effects and going back to design roots, prioritizing content. High-quality photographic materials, selection of type design, colorful illustrations and thoughtful layouts - this is the design we create today.
                Simplification of visual elements, or so called "flat design" is also part of this process. Its main advantage is that much more attention is paid to the materials, the priority of the displayed information and the content in general. Glossy buttons are replaced with icons, which allows us to use vector images and icon fonts. Web fonts are great for typography. The funny thing here is that the web was close to this idea from the very beginning, but that's why it is so young ...

            <h2>2014</h2>  <h2 class="names">Bright future</h2>
            <p id="2014">
                Over the years, design visualization and various attempts at presenting it in a browser have been the holy grail of web design. Imagine how designers easily move elements on the screen, and the finished code appears on its own! This is not about changing the order of elements as such, but about complete flexibility and control! Imagine that developers don't have to worry about browser compatibility and can instead focus entirely on solving the real problem!

                Formally, today there are several new ideas that support movement in this direction. New CSS units like vh, vw (viewport height and width) allow for much more flexibility in positioning elements. They also solve a problem that has puzzled many designers: why is it so hard to do center vertical alignment in CSS? Another cool idea that has become part of CSS is Flexbox, which allows you to create layouts and change them with a single property, instead of writing a bunch of code. Finally, web components is an even more solid endeavor, which is a bundle of elements bundled together, such as a gallery or registration form. This creates an opportunity to simplify the workflow, as the elements become building blocks that can be used many times, even independently.

                So what are your thoughts on the future of web design?

                Note: Years in parentheses indicate the beginning of a stage. These technologies have evolved at different rates over a long period of time, so by no means consider the period from 1998 to 2007 empty. It was then that the main evolution took place.
