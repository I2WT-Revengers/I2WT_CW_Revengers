                <h2>Web design</h2>
                <p>A web design is the sοul of a website. It plays an impοrtant rοle in a website’s perfοrmance and success. This is the reasοn why web develοpers pay specific attentiοn tο business web design. A perfect web design ensures better traffic and search engine ranking fοr a site. Let us see hοw beneficial CSS is in a web applicatiοn develοpment.</p>

                    <p>CSS οr cascading style sheets have made the develοpment of web pages a lοt easier. CSS allοws yοu tο easily link tο οther dοcuments in a website. With the help οf CSS yοu can have a cοntrοl οver the various elements in different web pages οf yοur site. CSS οnly defines the structure and cοntent presentation οf a website. It has nοthing tο dο with the design οf a website. Hοwever, the CSS influences hοw the design will lοοk like after the final prοcess is οver. Yοu can cοntrοl the font, pοsitiοning, cοlοr and style infοrmatiοn οf an entire website with the help οf a single CSS sheet.</p>
                                            <h2>Advantages</h2>
            <p>
                The main advantage of CSS is that the
                formatting can be applied to a set of web pages. If changes need to be done in
                formatting, then by editing the CSS document all pages of the site will be
                affected by the same change.An alternative to this would be to edit each page,
                in order for any change to take place. As a result,
                using CSS and all the supported style sheets, all the responsibility for
                the formatting of the websites is undertaken by a group (company) or several times
                by one person, even for multinational companies with dozens of websites.A direct consequence of the above is the minimization of the file size, as each rule used is referenced only once
                in the code, regardless of how many times it will be applied.Also, the pages that we design have a much better response, as with
                using a CSS file, the browser saves the file locally in the cache as a
                result, each time the page is reloaded, it does not need the document to be reloaded, even if it is another page of the website.
            </p>    
            
            <p>
                Finally, the use of CSS makes the pages more friendly to thesearch engine(Search Engine Optimization - SEO).Search Engines separate content from
                its format,therefore for a certain search on the page it is enough to just search for the
                content. Better SEOs give a higher chance of a page being visited,
                thus achieving its purpose of existence.

                                            <h2>Disadvantages</h2>
            
            <p>
                In addition to the advantages of CSS, consider the following disadvantages which
                Designers should take seriously:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <span>Speed.</span>For aBrowser to download an HTML and CSS file at the same time,
                    it always need more time than downloading a single HTML file.
                    However this is not so important when the user wants to browse to
                    a set of pages that use the same formatting (same file
                    CSS).
                
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <span>Different syntax from HTML.</span>CSS was developed completely independently
                    from HTML and uses a completely different syntax. Therefore,
                    a web developer should know two
                    different ways of shaping instead of one. Also, the CSS syntax is not
                    very friendly for the average user.
                
                    
                
                
                
                </li>
                
                
                
                
                
                <li>    
                    <span>Access to external files is required.</span>If a HTML document is saved
                    on the hard disk without the CSS file that defines its formatting, then
                    it will be lost. This way, the document will not be displayed correctly when the
                    user is offline.In the same way, all the pages
                    whose formatting depends on a CSS file when they lose the link
                    in this file, they will not be displayed correctly.
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <span>Easy elaboration and restorage.</span>It can be easily edited and
                    restoraged by anyone. Although this can also be considered as
                    qualification,considering the lack of security flaws in CSS, it would not be an exaggeration to consider it
                    serious disadvantage.Anyone who has the access to read or write
                    in the file may interrupt some functions or change hyperlinks
                    on websites.
                
                
                </li>
                
                <li>
                
                <span>Complexity in web design systems and templates.</span>
                    The CSS
                    files are annoying in software packages like Dreamweaver, which
                    use templates. This is because while creating
                    hyperlinks that are the right ones, when the pages are uploaded to the server these paths may be modified, causing problems in the
                    their appearance.
                
                </li>
                
                
                
                
            </ul>
            
        
        
                             
            </div>
