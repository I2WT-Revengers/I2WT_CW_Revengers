                <p>In nowadays world, we use websites everyday. And the way they are constructed is amazing. The main component of a website structure is HTML, Hyper Text Markup Language. (if you want to see othe components of which websites are made, click <a href = "main.html"> here</a>).

                <p>Hypertext Markup Language, or HTML, is a programming language used to describe the structure of information on a web page. Together, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript make up the essential building blocks of websites, with CSS controlling a page’s appearance, and JavaScript programming its functionality. You can think of HTML as providing the bones of a web page, while CSS provides the skin, and JavaScript provides the brains.

                    A web page can contain headings, paragraphs, images, videos, and many other types of data. Front-end developers use HTML elements to specify what kind of information each item on a web page contains — for instance, the “p” element indicates a paragraph. Developers also write HTML code to specify how different items relate to one another in the overall structure of the page.

                    Every website you open in your browser, from social networks to music services, uses HTML. A look under the hood of any website would reveal HTML code providing structure for all the page’s components.Hypertext Markup Language, or HTML, is a programming language used to describe the structure of information on a web page.
