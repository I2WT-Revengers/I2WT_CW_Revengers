            <h2>What are domains?</h2>
            <p><span>Domain</span> is the online address of the site, its location on the Internet. From a technical point of view, a domain address is a record in a database. When a user specifies a domain name in the search bar, the computer understands which site to display and to which address to send the request.</p>
            <h2>What does a domain name consist of?</h2>
            <p>All domains are organized hierarchically: they are made up of parts (levels). Third-level domains are created on the basis of second-level domains, and second-level domains - on the basis of first-level domains. Let's take a closer look at the types of domains:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Domain of the second (third, fourth, etc.) level or subdomain - the left side of the domain to the point In practice, this is any combination of characters that we come up with for the name of our future site (youtube.com).</li>
                <li>First level domain or domain zone - the right part of the domain after the dot. This part cannot be asked by anyone other than ICANN. By registering a "domain", we come up with a second-level domain and choose a zone.They can be geographic (.EU - EU countries, .AC - Ascension Island, etc.) or thematic (from old-timers like .COM. - commercial sphere, .BIZ - business sphere to new gTLD:. FLOWERS, .HEALTH, .Children, etc.).
                </li>
                <li>Zero-level domain is a dot after the domain zone (reg.ru.), which is not displayed in the address bar and is omitted when the domain is entered into the browser bar.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Table of some domains:</h2>

                <tr><td><a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/.aero" target="_blank">.aero</a></td><td>Air Transport</td><td>Verification of eligibility required. Only organizations related to air travel are registered.</td></tr>

Any individual or legal entity has the right to register, however, registration may be challenged in the future if this person does not engage in commercial activities in accordance with the domain charter. The TLD was created to alleviate the situation with the .com domain, which has become incredibly popular and, as a result, overcrowded.</td></tr>
                <tr><td><a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/.com" target="_blank">.com</a></td><td>Commercion</td><td>This is an open source TLD. Any natural or legal person has the right to register. Although originally intended for commercial businesses, it has become the “main” domain name TLD for a variety of reasons and is now used by all types of organizations, including educational institutions (usually private), individuals, and non-profit and semi-profit organizations. A registered domain name may be challenged if the owner cannot prove that the name was reserved without the purpose of resale. This limits cybersquatting.</td></tr>
                <tr><td><a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/.edu" target="_blank">.edu</a></td><td>Education</td><td>TLD .edu is designed for educational institutions from elementary schools to high schools. In 2001, the United States limited its use to higher education institutions accredited by recognized national agencies from a special accreditation list maintained by the US Department of Education. Therefore, this domain is almost exclusively used by US colleges and universities. Some educational institutions that do not meet the current registration criteria use this domain on a grandfather clause basis.</td></tr>
